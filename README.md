# MASSIVE
Setup of general environment: run the following command to make the initial setup
```
conda activate massive
```

## Creating dataset
Use the following command to create dataset
```

```
Since in the experiments, it is possible that we are using a subset of the data, the number of entries in these maps would be less and incompatible with the model. So create the map once with original dataset and use it for subsequent runs.
